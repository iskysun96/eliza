# Development Plan for Eliza's plugin-algorand Plugin

## Plugin Requirements

The `plugin-algorand` plugin should have a feature to transfer Algorand (ALGO) tokens from one account to another.

## External Dependencies

- [@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts) - A library for interacting with the Algorand blockchain.

## Development Plan

1. **Set up the Development Environment**:

    - Follow the instructions in the Eliza README to clone the repository, install dependencies, and build the project.

2. **Study the Plugin Template and Eliza Architecture**:

    - Study the plugin template in the `packages/_examples` folder to understand the structure and conventions used for Eliza plugins.
    - Familiarize yourself with the Eliza architecture and how plugins interact with the core system.

3. **Integrate the AlgoKit Utils Library**:

    - Install the `@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts` library by following the installation instructions in its README.
    - Study the library's documentation and API to understand how to use it for interacting with the Algorand blockchain.

4. **Implement the ALGO Transfer Feature**:

    - In the `packages/plugin-algorand/src/index.ts` file, define an action for transferring ALGO tokens.
    - Use the AlgoKit Utils library to interact with the Algorand blockchain and perform the token transfer.
    - Handle user input, such as the recipient's address and the amount to transfer.
    - Implement error handling and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

5. **Test and Debug**:

    - Write unit tests for the ALGO transfer feature to ensure it works as expected.
    - Test the plugin by running Eliza and interacting with the plugin's actions.
    - Debug any issues that arise and ensure the plugin is functioning correctly.

6. **Document the Plugin**:

    - Update the plugin's README file with documentation on how to use the ALGO transfer feature.
    - Provide examples and any necessary configuration steps.

7. **Submit a Pull Request**:
    - Once the plugin is complete and well-tested, submit a pull request to the Eliza repository.
    - The maintainers will review your code and provide feedback or merge it into the main codebase.

## Additional Information Needed

To provide more specific guidance and assistance, the following additional information is needed:

1. **Development Experience**: Your experience level with TypeScript, Node.js, and blockchain development.
2. **Availability and Timeframe**: An estimate of how much time you can dedicate to developing the plugin and your availability for communication and collaboration.
3. **Authentication and Accounts**: How you plan to handle user authentication and account management for the ALGO transfer feature.
4. **Error Handling and User Feedback**: The level of error handling and user feedback you expect from the plugin.
